# RandomMap
@random_map is a Twitter Bot that runs every several hours on a Raspberry Pi and tweets random aerial images of the Earth. I had a five hour layover in LAX and decided to try and be productive.

# Code
Uses two gems:
* Chatterbot - A really cool Ruby based Twitter Bot framework, used to tweet images
* static_map - An equally as cool gem that uses Google's Static Map API to generate static aerial images
